## Getting a Hang of Things: Uncharted Topics, Community, and Contribution

### Day 9 - Exploring Documentation and Docker:
I immersed myself in the documentation of various open source projects, gaining insights into their structures and functions. The exploration of Docker containers intrigued me, and I experimented with creating isolated environments for testing and development purposes. This experience shed light on the potential of containerization for efficient software deployment.

### Day 10 - Building Connections and Sharing:
I dedicated this day to connecting with the open source community through online platforms and virtual meetups. Engaging in discussions allowed me to exchange ideas and perspectives with fellow engineers and even people not directly linked to technology. I actively participated by sharing my thoughts on topics like neurotechnology etc., learning valuable insights from the experiences of others.

### Day 11 - Setting Up Twenty, Contributing, and Merging PR:
A significant milestone was achieved as I successfully set up the Twenty platform. Taking on an issue from the repository, and addressing it. The culmination of my efforts was a pull request (PR) that tackled the issue. Embracing the collaborative nature of open source, I welcomed feedback on my work and refined the code accordingly. Witnessing the acceptance of my PR into the main codebase was a gratifying validation of my contributions.
