## Unveiling Opportunities

### Day 05 - Open-Source Projects
I came across another project that fits my criteria and will be included in my list of projects to contribute to - Twenty.
Went through Twenty's documentation. I explored the codebase and configured a Docker development container within VScode to begin addressing issues. Given the inadequate information available for setting up the project within a development container, I reached out for assistance via the Discord channel.
