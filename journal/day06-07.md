## Restorative Pause

### Day 06-07 - Recharging and Exploring
Over the last two days, I decided to relax, reorganize, and recalibrate, while at it I joined an interesting Office Hour led by the innovators behind an impressive no-code AI solution, [Imagica](https://www.imagica.ai/). Concurrently, I devoted effort to the [Twenty](https://docs.twenty.com/developer/local-setup) project, figuring out challenges that come with setting up locally (Learnt more about Docker) and finding ways to solve them. The supportive Discord community offered valuable assistance, connecting me with peers navigating similar challenges. 

For a long time I've been interested in Neuroscience and its synergy to Computer Science, so I used this opportunity to embarked on a new exploration: delving into neurotechnology within the open source domain. Reaching out to industry experts in the field for advice. Finally I started out testing [Kinde's](https://github.com/kinde-oss) innovative authentication tool, to help access and give feedback to the team on Slack.
