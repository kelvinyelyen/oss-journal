## Getting Started

### Day 01 - Laying the Foundation
I successfully completed the OpenSauced introductory course on Open-Source. This experience deepened my understanding of the core objectives and historical evolution of Open-Source Software. I delved into the intricacies of contributing to Open-Source projects, achieving a significant milestone by initiating my first Pull Request within an Open-Source repository. To top it off, I proudly marked my [first highlight](https://insights.opensauced.pizza/feed/282) on the OpenSauced Platform.
