## Getting a Hang of Things: Progress and Git Exploration

### Day 13 - More Updates to the Twenty Project:

On the 12th day of the 100 Days of Open Source challenge, I advanced the Twenty project by submitting a pull request. I introduced a 'jobTitle' FieldText with an accompanying IconBriefcase, and integrated FieldURLs ('linkedinUrl' with IconBrandLinkedin and 'xURL' with IconBrandX) to the people show page. These enhancements enhance functionality and visual consistency, reflecting my ongoing dedication to the challenge and open-source community.

### Day 14 - Navigating Git Merging and Workflows:

I delved into Git merging rabithole, including techniques like git rebase, git merge, and the concept of squashing commits. This exploration took me on a bit of a journey, as I encountered challenges along the way. In particular, I grappled with the nuances of these Git and GitHub workflows. In my previous personal projects, I hadn't extensively used branches or focused on managing commit histories. As a result, adapting to these practices was initially unfamiliar territory.

However, I'm steadily making progress. I've set up a sandbox environmentâ€”where I can experiment and learn step by step. Through this hands-on approach, I'm gradually getting a better grasp of how to handle Git merging and workflow management. Each day brings me closer to mastering these essential skills and expanding my understanding of version control.
