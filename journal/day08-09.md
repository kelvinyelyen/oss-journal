## Embracing Diversity

### Day 08-09 - A little bit of everything
The journey so far has been truly eye openning, allowing me to break out of my comfort zone. I've had the opportunity to connect with new people, engage in open-source online communities, delve into unfamiliar technologies and codebases. Reflecting on the specific events of the past two days, I would characterize them as "productive". Our initial concerns while setting up the [Twenty](https://github.com/twentyhq/twenty) project have resulted in an enhanced documentation, which I've been actively exploring. This process has facilitated my learning about docker as well. Notably, a significant portion of my time was dedicated to a project centered around testing the [Kinde](https://github.com/kinde-oss) authentication service, accessible at [kinde-auth](https://github.com/kelvinyelyen/kinde-auth). This endeavor provided a rewarding experience as I conducted thorough testing and contributed valuable feedback on the technology. Looking ahead, my plans include immersing myself in more technical blogs and engaging in technical writing.
