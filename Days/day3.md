## Discovering Projects

### Description
I found a project that aligned with my needs - [Precedent](https://github.com/steven-tey/precedent). Precedent is an opinionated collection of components, hooks, and utilities for your Next.js project.

### Tasks completed:  
- I forked and cloned the repo to explore its codebase.
- I then opened an issue suggesting a feature addition [First Issue in Precedent](https://github.com/steven-tey/precedent/issues/64).
