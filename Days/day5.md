## Discovering Projects

### Description
I came across another project that fits my criteria and will be included in my list of projects to contribute to - Twenty.

### Tasks completed
- Went through Twenty's documentation.
- Explored the codebase and configured a Docker development container within VScode to begin addressing issues.

## Challenges faced
Given the inadequate information available for setting up the project within a development container, I reached out for assistance via the Discord channel.

## Resources used
