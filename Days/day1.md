## Getting Started

### Description
I successfully completed the OpenSauced introductory course on Open-Source, which involved acquiring a comprehensive understanding of the underlying objectives and historical evolution of Open-Source Software, gaining insights into the intricate processes associated with contributing to Open-Source projects, accomplishing the notable achievement of initiating my inaugural Pull Request within an Open-Source repository, and made my [first highlight](https://insights.opensauced.pizza/feed/282) on the OpenSauced Platform.
