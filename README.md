# 100 Days of Open Source Software (100DaysOfOSS)

## Introduction

Welcome to my 100 Days of Open Source Software (100DaysOfOSS) challenge! During this journey, I am committed to contributing to open source projects for the next 100 days. This challenge aims to enhance my skills, collaborate with the open source community, and make a positive impact on various projects.

## Goals

My goals for this challenge are as follows:

- Making daily contributions encompassing coding, bug fixes, documentation enhancements, and issue triage.
- Exploring diverse open source projects, including software libraries, web applications, tools, frameworks, to deepen my tech understanding.
- Prioritizing quality by rigorously testing, comprehensively documenting, and adhering to project guidelines in each pull request.
- Fostering effective open source collaboration through active engagement in discussions, community involvement, and seeking constructive feedback.
- Leveraging the collective wisdom of the open source community, learning from contributors, dissecting complex codebases, and adopting best practices.
- Launching an independent open source project alongside contributions, giving back and delivering value to users.


## Project Exploration

Throughout these 100 days, my current project pursuits (subject to evolution) include:
