# 100 Days of Open Source Software (100DaysOfOSS)

## Introduction

Welcome to my 100 Days of Open Source Software (100DaysOfOSS) challenge! During this journey, I am committed to contributing to open source projects for the next 100 days. This challenge aims to enhance my skills, collaborate with the open source community, and make a positive impact on various projects.

## Goals

My primary goals during this challenge are:

1. **Contribute Regularly**: Each day, I will make at least one contribution to an open source project. This can include code contributions, bug fixes, documentation improvements, or helping with issue triage.

2. **Diversify Contributions**: I will explore different types of open source projects, ranging from software libraries, web applications, tools, frameworks, and more. By diversifying my contributions, I aim to gain a broader understanding of various technologies.

3. **Quality Contributions**: While quantity matters, the quality of my contributions is equally important. I will ensure that my pull requests are well-tested, well-documented, and adhere to the project's guidelines.

4. **Collaborate and Communicate**: I will actively participate in discussions, engage with the community, and seek feedback on my contributions. Effective communication is key to successful open source collaboration.

5. **Learn from the Community**: The open source community is rich with knowledge and experience. I will make an effort to learn from other contributors, study codebases, and understand best practices.

6. **Create My Own Project**: Alongside contributing to existing projects, I aim to initiate my own open source project during this challenge. It will be an opportunity to give back and provide value to the community.

## Project Ideas

During the 100 days, I plan to contribute to the following projects (subject to change):

Feel free to recommend any other exciting open source projects that align with my goals. I'm open to exploring new opportunities!
