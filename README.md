# 100 Days of Open Source Software (100DaysOfOSS)

## Introduction

Welcome to my 100 Days of Open Source Software (100DaysOfOSS) challenge! During this journey, I am committed to contributing to open source projects for the next 100 days. This challenge aims to enhance my skills, collaborate with the open source community, and make a positive impact on various projects.

## Goals

I will contribute daily through coding, bug fixes, documentation, and issue triage. Exploring diverse open source projects will deepen my technical understanding. I'll prioritize quality by rigorous testing and comprehensive documentation, and I'll engage actively in discussions for effective collaboration. Learning from contributors and launching my own project while giving back will further enrich my experience.


## Project Exploration

Throughout these 100 days, my current project pursuits (subject to evolution) include:
- [Twenty](https://github.com/kelvinyelyen/twenty)

Other interesting projects i'll be jumping on soon
- [Infisical](https://github.com/Infisical/infisical)
- [Novel](https://github.com/steven-tey/novel)
- [Dub](https://github.com/steven-tey/dub)


Feel free to propose alternative open source opportunities that align with my objectives!

## Progress Monitoring

For accountability, I will document my journey through daily commits. Your engagement and observations are most welcome!
