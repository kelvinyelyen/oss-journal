# 100 Days of Open Source Software (100DaysOfOSS)

## Introduction

Taking on the 100 Days of Open Source Software (100DaysOfOSS) challenge to push my boundaries, my commitment is aimed to to contribute consistently to open source projects over the upcoming 100 days. This challenge is geared towards skill advancement, fostering collaborative efforts within the open source ecosystem, and effecting positive changes across diverse projects.

## Goals

I will contribute daily through coding, bug fixes, documentation, and issue triage. Exploring diverse open source projects will deepen my technical understanding. I'll prioritize quality by rigorous testing and comprehensive documentation, and I'll engage actively in discussions for effective collaboration. Learning from contributors and launching my own project while giving back will further enrich my experience.


## Project Exploration

During this period, I'll be focusing on the following projects (subject to evolution):
- [Twenty](https://github.com/kelvinyelyen/twenty)
- [Infisical](https://github.com/Infisical/infisical)

Additionally, I'm keen to explore these promising projects soon:
- [Dub](https://github.com/steven-tey/dub)
- [Novel](https://github.com/steven-tey/novel)


Feel free to propose alternative open source opportunities that align with my objectives!

## Progress Monitoring

For accountability, I will document my journey through daily commits. Your engagement and observations are most welcome!
